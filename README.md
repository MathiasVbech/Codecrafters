# Codecrafters Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to two Codecrafters challenges:

## HTTP Server (C#)
A custom HTTP server implementation that supports:

Basic HTTP request handling
* File operations (GET and POST)
* User-agent and echo endpoints
* Gzip compression support

### Notes

This is a challenge-specific implementation
Requires Codecrafters' specific testing environment
May not run as-is in a standard development environment

## DNS Forwarder (C++)
A DNS server that:

* Receives DNS queries
* Forwards queries to a specified resolver
* Handles DNS packet parsing and response merging

### Notes

Developed as part of a Codecrafters DNS server challenge
Designed for a specific testing framework
Requires specialized setup to function

## Important Disclaimer
These solutions were developed for specific Codecrafters coding challenges and are tightly integrated with their testing infrastructure. They are not meant to be standalone, production-ready applications and will likely not work if simply compiled and run in a standard environment.
